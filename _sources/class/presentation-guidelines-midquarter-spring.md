# Mid-quarter presentations

In spring most of our class meetings will be devoted to student presentations. At this point, project teams are far enough along that we can leverage project material for class discussions more directly related to student experiences in the capstone.

Each team will give one mid-quarter presentation of around 15-20 minutes on a topic of their choosing related to their project. 

## Presentation content

In contrast to quarter-end presentations and written project updates, which serve to summarize progress, these presentations should focus on a specific method, challenge, result, or other interesting aspect of their work that can serve as a learning opportunity for the class as a whole.

Here are some ideas about what to cover:

- a method, technique, or idea that you've learned about in the course of the project;
- new results and your interpretation of those results;
- a difficulty you're currently challenged by and your ideas for addressing it.

You're free to choose a topic you like, but the focus should be fairly specific; the presentation should not be an overview of your project or the most recent updates. 

You can assume the audience will have a basic familiarity with your project sponsor and objective (they will have read your most recent update for background), but you may need to reintroduce any background details especially important for what you'll talk about. 

## Format and schedule

Each class meeting can fit three presentations. Each presentation should be 15-20 minutes, leaving 5-10 minutes for discussion and the transition to the next group. Presenting teams can make use of the projector or blackboard. 

Scheduled slots were randomly assigned as follows.

Date | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3
---|---|---|---
April 18 | HG Insights | Carpe Data | CCBER
April 25 | Sprague | CalCOFI | Evidation (Julio)
May 2 | CITS | PwC | NRI
May 9 | *Guest lecture*
May 16 | AppFolio | ERI | Allthenticate 
May 23 | Evidation (Eric) | ENVENT


## For the audience

In preparation, students in the audience will read the most recent posts from presenting groups and fill out [this Google form](https://forms.gle/cMEgdm3DzMsW5y7h8) *once for each presenting group* (so multiple times per class meeting).

It's encouraged to come with at least one question -- this is a fairly helpful practice in attending any talk. Possibly the team's presentation will be on a different subject, but there may be time in class to ask it anyway.
