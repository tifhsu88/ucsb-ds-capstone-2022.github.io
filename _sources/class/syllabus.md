# Course Syllabus

**Description**

The project portion of the capstone sequence is cross-listed:

* PSTAT 197B (Winter)/197C (Spring)
* CMPSC 190DE (Winter)/190DF (Spring)

Students practice their data science and applied statistics skills by completing a hands-on team project on a practical problem proposed by a project sponsor. Students are expected to give regular oral presentations and prepare at least one written report on their research.

Each team will work closely with their sponsor and a project mentor on their research throughout both quarters. In addition, all students will meet once per week for discussions, workshops, and presentations to complmement their project experiences and support their progress in research.

**Meetings**

* (Winter) Mondays 2:00pm -- 3:15pm NH 1105 or via [Zoom](https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/81457783650?pwd=NnlybVFhSHFvSUtOWVBmRU12SUpFdz09)
* (Spring) Mondays 2:00pm -- 3:15pm in HSSB1173
* Weekly project team meetings as determined by project groups

## Outcomes and Assessments

**Learning outcomes**

Students are expected to fully engage with their project groups and with class meetings. In so doing, students will:

1. Carry out a hands-on research or industry project involving applications of statistics and data science from start to finish.
2. Develop and practice effective strategies for collaborative research and for communicating research outcomes.
3. Think critically about data ethics and the social implications of research.

**Assessments**

Attainment of these outcomes will be measured by the following group and individual assessments; letter grades will be assigned according to the relative weighting indicated for each assessment category.

* *Meetings/Participation (individual)*: 20%  
    - Attendance in project and class meetings 
* *Assigned Reading (individual)*: 20%
    - Offer at least one comment (question, answer, thought, etc.) on assigned readings
* *Deliverables (group)*: 50%
    - Written progress updates 
    - End-of-quarter presentations
* *Sponsor and mentor evaluations (individual)*: 10%  
    - Based on engagement and effort
