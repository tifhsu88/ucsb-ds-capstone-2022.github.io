# CalCOFI Project

California Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (calCOFI), a coastal research organization has been collecting physical, chemical, and biological data on the California Coast for the past 74 years. The organization focuses on protecting and studying the properties of the water column through a series of quarterly trips out to stations scattered 500 miles up and down the coast and 360 miles offshore, collecting data down to a depth of 500 meters. CalCOFI has challenged our capstone group with creating an interactive map paired with other visualizations that clearly display their data on hypoxia off the California Coast. Our sponsor from CalCOFI is Erin Satterthwaite and our capstone sponsor is Trevor Ruiz.
