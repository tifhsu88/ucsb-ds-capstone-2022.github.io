The [Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER)](https://www.ccber.ucsb.edu/) is working with our capstone team in order to continue advancing the research and understanding on bee ecology and taxonomy through image and trait digitalization. We will be working with high resolution, focal-stacked images of over 5,000 worldwide bee species. From these images, we hope to develop tools that can extract data that will be widely accessible to other researchers, industry, and government agencies. 

Our sponsor is Dr.Katja Seltmann from CCBER. 

The capstone team consists of Harper Klauke, Harleen Kaur, Jonathan Wong-Lau, and Nick Alexander. Our faculty mentorr is Joshua Bang.
