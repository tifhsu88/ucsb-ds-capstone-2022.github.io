The [Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER)](https://www.ccber.ucsb.edu/) is working with our capstone team in order to continue the research and understanding on bee ecology and taxonomy through image and trait digitalization. We will be working with high resolution, focal-stacked images of over 5,000 worldwide bee species. From these images, we will implement traditional and computational methods to tackle the "hairy" problem of specimen identification. Our plan is to extend our findings and methods to be accessible to other researchers, industry, and government agencies.

Our sponsor is Dr.Katja Seltmann from CCBER. 

The capstone team consists of Harper Klauke, Harleen Kaur, Jonathan Wong-Lau, and Nick Alexander. Our faculty mentor is Joshua Bang.
