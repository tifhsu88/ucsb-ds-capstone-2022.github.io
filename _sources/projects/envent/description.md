# ENVENT Lab

 
## Project Description
Founded in 2016, the  ENVENT lab @ UCSB ( Energy and Environment Transitions) at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is a hub for climate policy advocacy, climate communication, and environmental politics research. The lab is co-directed by Prof. Leah Stokes and Prof. Matto Mildenberger. 

We will be working with the ENVENT lab and Professor Mildenberger in order to expand upon his efforts to map climate opinion across the globe. We will be focusing on gathering demographic data from 140 surveys that span over 2500 subnational regions dating back to 1998 in order to build differentially predictive models on climate opinion.

The capstone team consists of Emma Franzblau, Annie Adams, Andrew Bissell, and Johnny Yu.
