Our project, sponsored by Evidation Health, is looking at the relationship between wearable data such as heart rate, hours of sleep etc. and changes in cognition and stress. Our project focuses particularly on healthcare workers. Our data was gathered from this population during the onset of the pandemic. We hope that our project will give insight into burnout and stress in this critically important population.
