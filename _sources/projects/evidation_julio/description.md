# Evidation (Julio's team)

## Our Sponsor

[Evidation Health](https://evidation.com/) is a company that helps connect individual participants to research studies. Their privacy-centered health tracking application helps facilitate this connection while keeping user information secure and confidential. Evidation Health partners with leading healthcare companies to analyze the collected clinical data and publish rigorous studies.

## Our Project

We are working with Evidation Health and focusing on the effects that COVID-19 has had on front line workers and their mood, energy, cough, and stress. These factors were measured using Garmin watches and Oura rings and analyzed against self-reported rating for each category.
